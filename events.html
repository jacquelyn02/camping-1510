                <br>I will be hosting three trips all will be a little different but some activities
                will remain the same and anyone can join.<br><br><br> 

    January 4th - 19th: We will be heading to Indian Springs State Park, this will mainly be a 
    fishing trip where I teach everyone how to fish, these sessions will be held on each trip but 
    this first main trip I will be mainly focusing on fishing so be sure to join if you're interested.<br><br>

    April 6th - 20th: I will be hosting a hunting trip in High Falls State Park, this will be a 
    mainly adult-held trip unless you wish for your child to be with you. I will have professionals 
    with me explaining the basics of hunting so we probably won't have a proper hunting session but 
    we will be going out in groups to scout out areas.<br><br> 

    October 7th - 28th: This final trip of the year will be a mixture of fishing and hunting and will 
    be held in Panola Mountain State Park so make sure you have all your gear ready! Anyone can join 
    as per usual just make sure you stay safe and warm since this trip is scheduled in November. 
    We will bring spare fishing rods and hunting rifles so if you do not have your own do not worry
    about coming empty-handed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
