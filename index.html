                <br>Hello and welcome to my Website!<br><br>

    My name is Jacquelyn but most people call me Jackie. The purpose of this website is to inform 
    people of my future events and what activities I have planned for said events.<br><br>

    My planned locations are of course set in Georgia, some camping grounds I would love to cover would be 
    Indian Springs State Park and High Falls State Park. I can't wait to meet you there.<br><br>

    Now for the fun activities I have planned, I have something for both the children and adults to enjoy. 
    Ranging from a 4-hour fishing session where children and their guardians can learn how to fish. We will be covering the basics of 
    course so new learners are free to join.<br><br>

    For the children only I have a grand campfire story to tell them once the sun goes down and when the day breaks I have a nice 
    little scavenger hunt for them to take part in; each day with different items to look for it's sure to be fun! Not to mention a play
    hunting game where I made little paper mache animals for the children to hunt down if they so wished. The first child to reach 10 
    points gets a special prize!<br><br>

    Now for the adults I have a more advanced fishing class for anyone interested it is best that you at least have the basics down 
    before coming down for the class. I have a few hiking areas we can venture into also, I hope you bought your best shoes for this 
    trip!

                    <!--the website i got the facts from: https://thewildguides.com/camping-wilderness-wildlife-facts/ 
                        and https://wildernesstimes.com/camping-facts/ -->
                    1. A Grizzly bear's bite can crush a bowling ball.<br><br>
                    2. Around 68% of adult campers prefer camping with their partner, meaning camping is 
                    more viewed as a family activity.<br><br>
                    3. The majority of campers have their smartphones packed with them while out in the 
                    wild, about ⅓ of them are turned off for the duration of the drip.<br><br>
                    4. Unsurprisingly, hiking and backpacking are the most camping activities, followed 
                    by fishing.<br><br>
                    5. The first campground in the US was Gunnery Camp, which was founded in Washington, 
                    Connecticut in 1861.<br><br>
