                <br>Greetings again as stated on the main home page this website is about camping and 
                anything else that comes with it such as fishing and hiking!<br><br>

I made this to reach anyone interested in learning and growing with me as I make this journey into new 
territory since camping is new to me. I made this to reach new and veteran campers when it comes to 
taking on the outdoors.<br><br>

People new to camping, such as myself, can struggle with me as we try to put up a tent, making a flame 
with flint and steel, and most likely getting lost while venturing in the woods; gotta make sure we have 
our maps!<br><br>

Veterns can lead us in the correct direction, everything is a learning experience of course, but with 
their guided help when needed anything is possible. I can't wait to learn from them and listen to their 
stories around a campfire!<br><br>

As I and new people take the tips we learn from these experts we can hopefully teach people who are in 
the same situation as us. We can give them a push in the right direction and give them useful trips when 
it comes to camping.<br><br>

I pride myself on my honesty, resourcefulness, and high value in safety so I can't wait to meet you on 
our journey.
